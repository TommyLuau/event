## Why Event?

Event allows easy and blazing fast setup of custom scriptevents, does not require any external dependencies. Event has a very simple and beginner friendly syntax that is suitable for everyone. 

Event also features timed events, a type of event that occurs only after a specified amount of time has passed.
